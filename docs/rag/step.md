2024 — “Reasoning RAG” becomes standard

New terms appear (informal but common):

Agentic RAG

Multi-step RAG

Planning-based RAG

Tool-augmented RAG

Industry reality:

Naive RAG shown to fail

Rerankers + reasoning loops become default

Evaluation & grounding emphasized

👉 Reasoning is now expected, not optional
in 2025, RAG includes reasoning, planning, and judgment logic.

One clean mental model (use this)

Think in layers of autonomy:

RAG = memory + judgment
Agent = goal-driven decision loop
MCP = standardized tool/memory access

They are not competitors.
They sit at different abstraction levels.

1️⃣ RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
What it is (modern meaning)

A deterministic-ish pipeline that:

Retrieves knowledge

Reasons about relevance

Produces a grounded answer

Key properties

Single request → single response

Reasoning is bounded

No long-term goals

No self-directed loops

Example

“What is the depreciation rule for laptops in Canada?”

Flow:

analyze → retrieve → rerank → assemble → answer

What RAG is not

Not autonomous

Not planning across time

Not choosing whether to act

👉 RAG = expert assistant, not an actor

2️⃣ Agent (Agentic systems)
What it is

An autonomous decision loop that:

Has a goal

Chooses actions

Uses tools (including RAG)

Iterates until done or stopped

Key properties

Multi-step

Stateful

Can fail, retry, change strategy

Often async

Example

“Review these 200 invoices, flag risky ones, and summarize issues.”

Flow:

plan → retrieve → analyze → act → observe → repeat


The agent may:

Call RAG multiple times

Use databases

Run calculations

Ask follow-up questions

👉 Agents use RAG, they don’t replace it

3️⃣ MCP (Model Context Protocol)
What it is (important)

MCP is not AI behavior.
It is a protocol / interface standard.

Think:

“USB-C for LLM tools and memory”

What MCP does

Standardizes how models access:

Tools

Files

Databases

RAG systems

Decouples model ↔ system

What MCP does not do

No reasoning

No autonomy

No planning

Example

An agent calls:

mcp://rag/search
mcp://db/query
mcp://fs/read


👉 MCP is plumbing, not intelligence

Side-by-side (very important)
Dimension	RAG	Agent	MCP
Purpose	Grounded answers	Goal completion	Standardized access
Reasoning	Yes (bounded)	Yes (iterative)	No
Autonomy	No	Yes	No
State	Request-scoped	Long-lived	N/A
Loops	No	Yes	No
Uses tools	Sometimes	Always	Enables
Uses RAG	N/A	Yes	Indirect
Replaces RAG	❌	❌	❌
The hierarchy (this matters)
Agent
 ├── uses RAG
 ├── uses tools
 └── uses MCP to talk to them


Or in plain English:

RAG = “How do I answer this question correctly?”

Agent = “What should I do next to achieve my goal?”

MCP = “How do I talk to the systems that help me?”

Practical rules (memorize these)
Rule 1

If your system answers one question at a time → it’s RAG

Rule 2

If your system decides what to do next → it’s an Agent

Rule 3

If you’re arguing about MCP vs RAG, you’re mixing layers

Common mistake (you’re not making it, but many do)

“Agents replace RAG”

❌ Wrong.

Agents need RAG more than anyone, otherwise they hallucinate across steps.

Final one-sentence takeaway

RAG is grounded reasoning, agents are autonomous decision-makers, and MCP is the protocol that lets models talk to both.

If you want, I can:

Map these directly to your FastAPI architecture

Show when NOT to use agents

Explain why most teams regret agent-first designs

Just tell me where you want to go next.
